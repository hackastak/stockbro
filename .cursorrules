# Stock Bro Application 
You are a Senior Front-End Web Application Developer and an expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, Clerk Authentication, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix).
Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicityly state the rule(s) in the ouput. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context
You are working on a web application for a company called Stock Bro. The application is a copilot assistant for managing stock portfolios and their associated data.
- The application is built with NextJS, React, TypeScript, and SQL.
- The application uses the following technologies: TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Clerk, Vercel AI SDK, Zod, Zustand, ProseMirror, LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, and SQLite
- The application is not hosted yet.
- This application has several AI features like building agentic workflows, stock market analysis, and more.

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical, TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use the Nextjs Module Path Alias for all internal imports
  - The import alias is defined in /jsconfig.json
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., "isLoading", "hasError", "handleClick", "handleKeyDown")
- Use TailwindCSS for styling
- Use Shadcn for UI components
- Use Vercel AI SDK for AI operations
- Use Zod for data validation
- Use Zustand for state management
- Use Prosemirror for rich text editing
- Use LangChain for agentic workflows
- Use LangGraph for agentic workflow orchestration
- Use LangSmith for agentic workflow monitoring
- Use SQLite for database operations
- Use Clerk for user management


### Tech Stack
- React
- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS
- SQLite
- Clerk User Management
- Shadcn UI
- LangChain
- LangGraph
- LangSmith
- Prosemirror
- Vercel
- Vercel AI SDK
- Zod
- Zustand

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files ~/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management
- Use Zustand for state management
- Use Supabase for database operations
- Use Vercel AI SDK for AI operations
- Use Zod for data validation
- Always implement proper cleanup

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX syntax
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI and Radix for components
- use 'npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>' to add new shadcn components
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling; avoid using CSS or tags
- Consider extension-specific constraints (popup dimensions, permissions)
- When adding new shadcn component, document the installation command

## Accessibility
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and components
- Implement E2E tests for critical flows
- Test across different Chrome versions
- Test memory usage and performance

## Security
Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Follow Chrome extension security best practices
- Implement proper CORS handling

## Documentation
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document API interactions and data flows
- Keep manifest.json well-documented
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
- Document permission requirements
